\p{This paper improves the treatment of equality in guarded dependent type theory (𝖦𝖣𝖳𝖳), by combining it with cubical type theory (𝖢𝖳𝖳). 𝖦𝖣𝖳𝖳 is an extensional type theory with guarded recursive types, which are useful for building models of program logics, and for programming and reasoning with coinductive types. We wish to implement 𝖦𝖣𝖳𝖳 with decidable type checking, while still supporting non-trivial equality proofs that reason about the extensions of guarded recursive constructions. 𝖢𝖳𝖳 is a variation of Martin-Löf type theory in which the identity type is replaced by abstract paths between terms. 𝖢𝖳𝖳 provides a computational interpretation of functional extensionality, enjoys canonicity for the natural numbers type, and is conjectured to support decidable type-checking. Our new type theory, guarded cubical type theory (𝖦𝖢𝖳𝖳), provides a computational interpretation of extensionality for guarded recursive types. This further expands the foundations of 𝖢𝖳𝖳 as a basis for formalisation in mathematics and computer science. We present examples to demonstrate the expressivity of our type theory, all of which have been checked using a prototype type-checker implementation. We show that 𝖢𝖳𝖳 can be given semantics in presheaves on #{\C\times\D}, where \C is the cube category, and \D is any small category with an initial object. We then show that the category of presheaves on #{\C\times\omega} provides semantics for 𝖦𝖢𝖳𝖳.}
